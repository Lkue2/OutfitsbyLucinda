				Hi! My name is <b>Lucinda Kue</b> and I'm a second year here at UW-Madison. 
				<b>Fashion</b> has always been a big part of my life and a big outlet to getting to express my creativity.
				I got super into fashion my freshman year of college and have been documenting my outfits since.
				I decided to create this webpage to document my fashion and be a way for others and myself to get inspiration 
				on fashion and for outfits! I hope you enjoy my outfits and are able to find a way to express yourself through fashion as well! To follow my life style and see the outfits I wear on a daily, follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luclnda_/">Instagram</a>. :)
